# Karamoja Food Security Monitoring Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of agricultural productivity in the Karamoja region. It utilizes Python for data processing, Tableau for interactive visualization, and a final presentation to communicate key food security recommendations.

##  Key Findings
* *Crop Productivity:* Maize is nearly 4x more productive than sorghum, making it a critical asset for food security planning.
* *Regional Vulnerability:* Moroto District is identified as the most food-insecure area, showing the lowest yields for both crops.
* *Yield Variance:* Box plots reveal high disparity in sub-counties within districts like Kaabong and Nakapiripirit, indicating inconsistent farming success.
* *Efficiency Outliers:* Scatter plots identify specific sub-counties like Kacheri that underperform relative to their land size, requiring targeted intervention.

##  Components
1. *Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb):* Contains the Python code for data cleaning, outlier detection, and statistical visualizations.
2. *Tableau Dashboard:* An interactive tool for real-time monitoring of district and sub-county crop statistics.
3. *Project Presentation:* A summary of findings and strategic recommendations for NGOs and government bodies.

##  Recommendations
* *Urgent Intervention:* Prioritize food aid and resource allocation for Moroto and Napak.
* *Crop Promotion:* Encourage a shift toward maize cultivation in areas with suitable soil conditions.
* *Ongoing Monitoring:* Use the provided Tableau dashboard to track seasonal changes and resource efficiency.
